# Smart Portable Traffic Signal System For Single Lane Roadside Constructionâ€‹
This is a webpage to display data from an esp32 using ble (bluetooth low energy). 
It builds off of [sessiom.github.io/trafficMonitor](sessiom.github.io/trafficMonitor).
The data from each session is saved to mongoDB. 
This is part of my teams Senior Design Project in which we are building two street signs for 
single-lane roadside construction that communicate which each other much like traffic flaggers.
In addition, this repository has the esp32 code, espCam code for each sign and the object detection code.
