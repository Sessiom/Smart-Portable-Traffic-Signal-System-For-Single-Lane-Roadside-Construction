# traffic Monitor 2
This is a webpage to display data from an esp32 using ble (bluetooth low energy). 
It builds off of [sessiom.github.io/trafficMonitor](sessiom.github.io/trafficMonitor).
The data is also saved to mongoDB to look at past sessions. 
It is part of my teams Senior Design Project in which we are building two street signs for 
single-lane roadside construction that communicate which each other much like traffic flaggers.
